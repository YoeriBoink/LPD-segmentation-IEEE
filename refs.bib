	abstract = {A method for photoacoustic tomography is presented that uses line integrals over the acoustic wave field from a photoacoustic source for the reconstruction of a three-dimensional image. The line integrals are acquired with an optical line sensor based on a Mach–Zehnder interferometer. Image reconstruction is a two-step process. In the first step data from a scan of the line outside the object are used to reconstruct a linear projection of the source distribution. In the second step the inverse linear Radon transform is applied to multiple projections taken at different directions. This study focuses on the first step comparing two different open scan curves of the line detector around the object and corresponding two-dimensional reconstruction algorithms. An open curve, such as a 180° arc or an ‘L’ formed by two lines, establishes a limited view problem for which limitations exist concerning the stability of the reconstruction. Using experimental data from phantoms, time domain direct and iterative reconstruction algorithms as well as frequency domain (FD) algorithms are compared. The results indicate that although the image quality for all algorithms is similar, the FD algorithms offer much faster reconstruction speed, whereas the time domain algorithms allow for a refinement of image quality by including special correction procedures.}

abstract="This paper focuses on multi-scale approaches for variational methods and corresponding gradient flows. Recently, for convex regularization functionals such as total variation, new theory and algorithms for nonlinear eigenvalue problems via nonlinear spectral decompositions have been developed. Those methods open new directions for advanced image filtering. However, for an effective use in image segmentation and shape decomposition, a clear interpretation of the spectral response regarding size and intensity scales is needed but lacking in current approaches. In this context, {\$}{\$}L^1{\$}{\$}data fidelities are particularly helpful due to their interesting multi-scale properties such as contrast invariance. Hence, the novelty of this work is the combination of {\$}{\$}L^1{\$}{\$}-based multi-scale methods with nonlinear spectral decompositions. We compare {\$}{\$}L^1{\$}{\$}with {\$}{\$}L^2{\$}{\$}scale-space methods in view of spectral image representation and decomposition. We show that the contrast invariant multi-scale behavior of {\$}{\$}L^1-TV{\$}{\$}promotes sparsity in the spectral response providing more informative decompositions. We provide a numerical method and analyze synthetic and biomedical images at which decomposition leads to improved segmentation.",

abstract="Variational models for image segmentation have many applications, but can be slow to compute. Recently, globally convex segmentation models have been introduced which are very reliable, but contain TV-regularizers, making them difficult to compute. The previously introduced Split Bregman method is a technique for fast minimization of L1 regularized functionals, and has been applied to denoising and compressed sensing problems. By applying the Split Bregman concept to image segmentation problems, we build fast solvers which can out-perform more conventional schemes, such as duality based methods and graph-cuts. The convex segmentation schemes also substantially outperform conventional level set methods, such as the Chan-Vese level set-based segmentation algorithm. We also consider the related problem of surface reconstruction from unorganized data points, which is used for constructing level set representations in 3 dimensions. The primary purpose of this paper is to examine the effectiveness of ``Split Bregman'' techniques for solving these problems, and to compare this scheme with more conventional methods.",

abstract="Accelerating the acquisition of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a challenging problem, and many works have been proposed to reconstruct images from undersampled k-space data. However, if the main purpose is to extract certain quantitative measures from the images, perfect reconstructions may not always be necessary as long as the images enable the means of extracting the clinically relevant measures. In this paper, we work on jointly predicting cardiac motion estimation and segmentation directly from undersampled data, which are two important steps in quantitatively assessing cardiac function and diagnosing cardiovascular diseases. In particular, a unified model consisting of both motion estimation branch and segmentation branch is learned by optimising the two tasks simultaneously. Additional corresponding fully-sampled images are incorporated into the network as a parallel sub-network to enhance and guide the learning during the training process. Experimental results using cardiac MR images from 220 subjects show that the proposed model is robust to undersampled data and is capable of predicting results that are close to that from fully-sampled ones, while bypassing the usual image reconstruction stage.",

SBH-PACT clearly reveals tumors by observing higher blood vessel densities associated with tumors at high spatial resolution, showing early promise for high sensitivity in radiographically dense breasts. In addition to blood vessel imaging, the high imaging speed enables dynamic studies, such as photoacoustic elastography, which identifies tumors by showing less compliance. We imaged breast cancer patients with breast sizes ranging from B cup to DD cup, and skin pigmentations ranging from light to dark. SBH-PACT identified all the tumors without resorting to ionizing radiation or exogenous contrast, posing no health risks.},

As t ??? ??? the solution converges to a steady state which is the denoised image. The numerical algorithm is simple and relatively fast. The results appear to be state-of-the-art for very noisy images. The method is noninvasive, yielding sharp edges in the image.

In photoacoustic tomography acoustic pressure waves are induced by illuminating a semitransparent sample with pulsed electromagnetic radiation and are measured on a detection surface outside the sample. The imaging problem consists in reconstructing the initial pressure sources from those measurements. The first solution to this problem is based on the time reversal of the acoustic pressure field with a second order embedded boundary method. The pressure on the arbitrarily shaped detection surface is set to coincide with the measured data in reversed temporal order. In the second approach the reconstruction problem is solved by calculating the far-field approximation, a concept well known in physics, where the generated acoustic wave is approximated by an outgoing spherical wave with the reconstruction point as center. Numerical simulations are used to compare the proposed universal reconstruction methods with existing algorithms.},

We demonstrate a reconstruction method that allows the optical absorption distribution of a sample to be reconstructed without knowing the impulse response of the ultrasonic transducer. A convolution relationship between photoacoustic signals measured by an ultrasound transducer and optical absorption distribution is developed. Based on this theory, the projection of the optical absorption distribution of a sample can be obtained directly by deconvolving the recorded PA signal originating from a point source out of that from the sample. And a modified filtered back projection algorithm is used to reconstruct the optical absorption distribution. We constructed a photoacoustic imaging system to validate the reconstruction method and the experimental results demonstrated that the reconstructed images agreed well with the original phantom samples.

For the Shepp-Logan phantom we obtain {\textgreater}6 dB PSNR improvement against all compared methods. For human phantoms the corresponding improvement is 6.6 dB over TV and 2.2 dB over learned post-processing along with a substantial improvement in the structural similarity index. Finally, our algorithm involves only ten forward-back-projection computations, making the method feasible for time critical clinical applications.},

Recently, there have been interesting developments on explicit formulations of the adjoint operator, demonstrating that iterative methods could be an attraktive choice for photoacoustic image reconstruction. In this work, we propose several modifications of current formulations of the adjoint operator which help speed up the convergence and yield improved error estimates. We establish a stability analysis and show that, with our choices of the adjoint operator, Landweber's and the CG methods can achieve a linear rate of convergence either in {\$}L{\^{}}2{\$} or {\$}H{\^{}}1{\$} norm under the visibility condition. In addition, we analyze the normal operator from the microlocal analysis point of view. This helps us to have more insight into the convergence speed of the iterative methods as well as choosing proper weights for the mapping spaces. Finally, we present numerical results using various iterative reconstruction methods for trapping as well as non-trapping sound speed. Our results demonstrate that Nesterov's fast gradient and the CG methods converge faster than Landweber's and iterative time reversal methods in the visible as well as the invisible case.},

@article{Arridge2016a,
abstract = {Current 3D photoacoustic tomography (PAT) systems offer either high image quality or high frame rates but are not able to deliver high spatial and temporal resolution simultaneously, which limits their ability to image dynamic processes in living tissue. A particular example is the planar Fabry-Perot (FP) scanner, which yields high-resolution images but takes several minutes to sequentially map the photoacoustic field on the sensor plane, point-by-point. However, as the spatio-temporal complexity of many absorbing tissue structures is rather low, the data recorded in such a conventional, regularly sampled fashion is often highly redundant. We demonstrate that combining variational image reconstruction methods using spatial sparsity constraints with the development of novel PAT acquisition systems capable of sub-sampling the acoustic wave field can dramatically increase the acquisition speed while maintaining a good spatial resolution: First, we describe and model two general spatial sub-sampling schemes. Then, we discuss how to implement them using the FP scanner and demonstrate the potential of these novel compressed sensing PAT devices through simulated data from a realistic numerical phantom and through measured data from a dynamic experimental phantom as well as from in-vivo experiments. Our results show that images with good spatial resolution and contrast can be obtained from highly sub-sampled PAT data if variational image reconstruction methods that describe the tissues structures with suitable sparsity-constraints are used. In particular, we examine the use of total variation regularization enhanced by Bregman iterations. These novel reconstruction strategies offer new opportunities to dramatically increase the acquisition speed of PAT scanners that employ point-by-point sequential scanning as well as reducing the channel count of parallelized schemes that use detector arrays.},

This method can be used in computer analyses of retinal images, e.g., in automated screening for diabetic retinopathy. The system is based on extraction of image ridges, which coincide approximately with vessel centerlines. The ridges are used to compose primitives in the form of line elements. With the line elements an image is partitioned into patches by assigning each image pixel to the closest line element. Every line element constitutes a local coordinate frame for its corresponding patch. For every pixel, feature vectors are computed that make use of properties of the patches and the line elements. The feature vectors are classified using a kappaNN-classifier and sequential forward feature selection. The algorithm was tested on a database consisting of 40 manually labeled images. The method achieves an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.952. The method is compared with two recently published rule-based methods of Hoover et al. and Jiang et al.

abstract = {We propose a partially learned approach for the solution of ill posed inverse problems with not necessarily linear forward operators. The method builds on ideas from classical regularization theory and recent advances in deep learning to perform learning while making use of prior information about the inverse problem encoded in the forward operator, noise model and a regularizing functional. The method results in a gradient-like iterative scheme, where the "gradient" component is learned using a convolutional network that includes the gradients of the data discrepancy and regularizer as input in each iteration. We present results of such a partially learned gradient scheme on a non-linear tomographic inversion problem with simulated data from both the Sheep-Logan phantom as well as a head CT. The outcome is compared against FBP and TV reconstruction and the proposed method provides a 5.4 dB PSNR improvement over the TV reconstruction while being significantly faster, giving reconstructions of 512 x 512 volumes in about 0.4 seconds using a single GPU.},

abstract = {While variational methods have been among the most powerful tools for solving linear inverse problems in imaging, deep (convolutional) neural networks have recently taken the lead in many challenging benchmarks. A remaining drawback of deep learning approaches is their requirement for an expensive retraining whenever the specific problem, the noise level, noise type, or desired measure of fidelity changes. On the contrary, variational methods have a plug-and-play nature as they usually consist of separate data fidelity and regularization terms. In this paper we study the possibility of replacing the proximal operator of the regularization used in many convex energy minimization algorithms by a denoising neural network. The latter therefore serves as an implicit natural image prior, while the data term can still be chosen independently. Using a fixed denoising neural network in exemplary problems of image deconvolution with different blur kernels and image demosaicking, we obtain state-of-the-art reconstruction results. These indicate the high generalizability of our approach and a reduction of the need for problem-specific training. Additionally, we discuss novel results on the analysis of possible optimization algorithms to incorporate the network into, as well as the choices of algorithm parameters and their relation to the noise level the neural network is trained on.},

abstract = {Real-time monitoring of functional tissue parameters, such as local blood oxygenation, based on optical imaging could provide groundbreaking advances in the diagnosis and interventional therapy of various diseases. While photoacoustic (PA) imaging is a novel imaging concept with great potential to measure optical absorption deep inside tissue, quantification of the measurements remains a major challenge to be addressed. In this paper, we introduce the first machine learning-based approach to quantitative PA tomography (qPAT), which relies on learning the fluence in a voxel to deduce the corresponding optical absorption. The bottleneck of training data generation is overcome by encoding relevant information of the measured signal and the characteristics of the imaging system in voxel-based context images, which allow the generation of thousands of training samples from a single simulated PAT image. Comprehensive in silico experiments demonstrate that the concept of local context encoding (LCE) enables highly accurate and robust quantification (1) of the local fluence and the optical absorption from single wavelength PAT images as well as (2) of local oxygenation from multi wavelength PAT images.},

In this work, we develop and investigate a discrete imaging model for PACT that is based on the exact photoacoustic (PA) wave equation and facilitates the circumvention of these limitations. A key contribution of the work is the establishment of a procedure to implement a matched forward and backprojection operator pair associated with the discrete imaging model, which permits application of a wide-range of modern image reconstruction algorithms that can mitigate the effects of data incompleteness and noise. The forward and backprojection operators are based on the k-space pseudospectral method for computing numerical solutions to the PA wave equation in the time domain. The developed reconstruction methodology is investigated by use of both computer-simulated and experimental PACT measurement data.},

abstract = {The use of optical radiation in medical physics is important in several fields for both treatment and diagnosis. In all cases an analytic and computable model of the propagation of radiation in tissue is essential for a meaningful interpretation of the procedures. A finite element method (FEM) for deriving photon density inside an object, and photon flux at its boundary, assuming that the photon transport model is the diffusion approximation to the radiative transfer equation, is introduced herein. Results from the model for a particular case are given: the calculation of the boundary flux as a function of time resulting from a delta-function input to a two-dimensional circle (equivalent to a line source in an infinite cylinder) with homogeneous scattering and absorption properties. This models the temporal point spread function of interest in near infrared spectroscopy and imaging. The convergence of the FEM results are demonstrated, as the resolution of the mesh is increased, to the analytical expression for the Green's function for this system. The diffusion approximation is very commonly adopted as appropriate for cases which are scattering dominated, i.e., where mu s {\textgreater}{\textgreater} mu a, and results from other workers have compared it to alternative models. In this article a high degree of agreement with a Monte Carlo method is demonstrated. The principle advantage of the FE method is its speed. It is in all ways as flexible as Monte Carlo methods and in addition can produce photon density everywhere, as well as flux on the boundary. One disadvantage is that there is no means of deriving individual photon histories.},

abstract = {We designed, fabricated and tested the laser optoacoustic imaging system for breast cancer detection (LOIS-64), which fuses optical and acoustic imaging techniques in one modality by utilizing pulsed optical illumination and ultrawide-band ultrasonic detection of resulting optoacoustic (OA) signals. The system was designed to image a single breast slice in craniocaudal or mediolateral projection with an arc-shaped array of 64 ultrawide-band acoustic transducers. The system resolution on breast phantoms was at least 0.5 mm. The single-channel sensitivity of 1.66 mVPa was estimated to be sufficient for single-pulse imaging of 6 to 11 mm tumors through the whole imaging slice of the breast. The implemented signal processing using the wavelet transform allowed significant reduction of the low-frequency (LF) acoustic noise, allowed localization of the optoacoustic signals from tumors, and enhanced the contrast and sharpened the boundaries of the optoacoustic images of the tumors. During the preliminary clinical studies on 27 patients, the LOIS-64 was able to visualize 18 out of 20 malignant lesions suspected from mammography and ultrasound images and confirmed by the biopsy performed after the optoacoustic tomography (OAT) procedure.},

abstract = {Applying standard algorithms to sparse data problems in photoacoustic tomography (PAT) yields low-quality images containing severe under-sampling artifacts. To some extent, these artifacts can be reduced by iterative image reconstruction algorithms which allow to include prior knowledge such as smoothness, total variation (TV) or sparsity constraints. These algorithms tend to be time consuming as the forward and adjoint problems have to be solved repeatedly. Further, iterative algorithms have additional drawbacks. For example, the reconstruction quality strongly depends on a-priori model assumptions about the objects to be recovered, which are often not strictly satisfied in practical applications. To overcome these issues, in this paper, we develop direct and efficient reconstruction algorithms based on deep learning. As opposed to iterative algorithms, we apply a convolutional neural network, whose parameters are trained before the reconstruction process based on a set of training data. For actual image reconstruction, a single evaluation of the trained network yields the desired result. Our presented numerical results (using two different network architectures) demonstrate that the proposed deep learning approach reconstructs images with a quality comparable to state of the art iterative reconstruction methods.},

abstract = {OAPA Interventional applications of photoacoustic imaging typically require visualization of point-like targets, such as the small, circular, cross-sectional tips of needles, catheters, or brachytherapy seeds. When these point-like targets are imaged in the presence of highly echogenic structures, the resulting photoacoustic wave creates a reflection artifact that may appear as a true signal. We propose to use deep learning techniques to identify these type of noise artifacts for removal in experimental photoacoustic data. To achieve this goal, a convolutional neural network (CNN) was first trained to locate and classify sources and artifacts in pre-beamformed data simulated with k-Wave. Simulations initially contained one source and one artifact with various medium sound speeds and 2D target locations. Based on 3,468 test images, we achieved a 100 {\&} {\#}x0025; success rate in classifying both sources and artifacts. After adding noise to assess potential performance in more realistic imaging environments, we achieved at least 98 {\&} {\#}x0025; success rates for channel signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) of -9dB or greater, with a severe decrease in performance below -21dB channel SNR. We then explored training with multiple sources and two types of acoustic receivers and achieved similar success with detecting point sources. Networks trained with simulated data were then transferred to experimental waterbath and phantom data with 100 {\&} {\#}x0025; and 96.67 {\&} {\#}x0025; source classification accuracy, respectively (particularly when networks were tested at depths that were included during training). The corresponding mean  {\&} {\#}x00B1; one standard deviation of the point source location error was 0.40  {\&} {\#}x00B1; 0.22 mm and 0.38  {\&} {\#}x00B1; 0.25 mm for waterbath and phantom experimental data, respectively, which provides some indication of the resolution limits of our new CNN-based imaging system. We finally show that the CNNbased information can be displayed in a novel artifact-free image format, enabling us to effectively remove reflection artifacts from photoacoustic images, which is not possible with traditional geometry-based beamforming.},

We focus on two methods to decrease the radiation dose: (1) x-ray tube current reduction, which reduces the signal-to-noise ratio, and (2) x-ray beam interruption , which undersamples data and results in images with aliasing artifacts. While the learned VN denoises the current-reduced images in the first case, it reconstructs the undersam-pled data in the second case. Different VNs for denoising and reconstruction are trained on a single clinical 3D abdominal data set. The VNs are compared against state-of-the-art model-based denoising and sparse reconstruction techniques on a different clinical abdominal 3D data set with 4-fold dose reduction. Our results suggest that the proposed VNs enable higher radiation dose reductions and/or increase the image quality for a given dose.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2018 Optical Society of America under the terms of the OSA Open Access Publishing Agreement. Photoacoustic imaging enables the imaging of soft biological tissue with combined optical contrast and ultrasound resolution. One of the targets of interest is tissue vasculature. However, the photoacoustic images may not directly provide the information on, for example, vasculature structure. Therefore, the images are improved by reducing noise and artefacts, and processed for better visualisation of the target of interest. In this work, we present a new segmentation method of photoacoustic images that also straightforwardly produces assessments of its reliability. The segmentation depends on parameters which have a natural tendency to increase the reliability as the parameter values monotonically change. The reliability is assessed by counting classifications of image voxels with different parameter values. The resulting segmentation with reliability offers new ways and tools to analyse photoacoustic images and new possibilities for utilising them as anatomical priors in further computations. Our MATLAB implementation of the method is available as an open-source software package [P. Raumonen, Matlab, 2018].},

abstract = {The problem of reconstruction of a function from spherical means is at the heart of several modern imaging modalities and other applications. In this paper we derive universal back-projection-type reconstruction formulas for recovering a function in arbitrary dimension from averages over spheres centered on the boundary of an arbitrarily shaped bounded convex domain with smooth boundary. Provided that the unknown function is supported inside that domain, the derived formulas recover the unknown function up to an explicitly computed integral operator. For elliptical domains the integral operator is shown to vanish and hence we establish exact inversion formulas for recovering a function from spherical means centered on the boundary of elliptical domains in arbitrary dimension.},

We introduce a stochastic variational inference and learning algorithm that scales to large datasets and, under some mild differentiability conditions, even works in the intractable case. Our contributions is two-fold. First, we show that a reparameterization of the variational lower bound yields a lower bound estimator that can be straightforwardly optimized using standard stochastic gradient methods. Second, we show that for i.i.d. datasets with continuous latent variables per datapoint, posterior inference can be made especially efficient by fitting an approximate inference model (also called a recognition model) to the intractable posterior using the proposed lower bound estimator. Theoretical advantages are reflected in experimental results.},

abstract = {Purpose: To allow fast and high-quality reconstruction of clinical accelerated multi-coil MR data by learning a variational network that combines the mathematical structure of variational models with deep learning. Theory and Methods: Generalized compressed sensing reconstruction formulated as a variational model is embedded in an unrolled gradient descent scheme. All parameters of this formulation, including the prior model defined by filter kernels and activation functions as well as the data term weights, are learned during an offline training procedure. The learned model can then be applied online to previously unseen data. Results: The variational network approach is evaluated on a clinical knee imaging protocol. The variational network reconstructions outperform standard reconstruction algorithms in terms of image quality and residual artifacts for all tested acceleration factors and sampling patterns. Conclusion: Variational network reconstructions preserve the natural appearance of MR images as well as pathologies that were not included in the training data set. Due to its high computational performance, i.e., reconstruction time of 193 ms on a single graphics card, and the omission of parameter tuning once the network is trained, this new approach to image reconstruction can easily be integrated into clinical workflow.},

abstract = {Photoacoustic tomography is a hybrid imaging technique that combines high optical tissue contrast with high ultrasound resolution. Direct reconstruction methods such as filtered backprojection, time reversal and least squares suffer from curved line artefacts and blurring, especially in case of limited angles or strong noise. In recent years, there has been great interest in regularised iterative methods. These methods employ prior knowledge on the image to provide higher quality reconstructions. However, easy comparisons between regularisers and their properties are limited, since many tomography implementations heavily rely on the specific regulariser chosen. To overcome this bottleneck, we present a modular reconstruction framework for photoacoustic tomography. It enables easy comparisons between regularisers with different properties, e.g. nonlinear, higher-order or directional. We solve the underlying minimisation problem with an efficient first-order primal-dual algorithm. Convergence rates are optimised by choosing an operator dependent preconditioning strategy. Our reconstruction methods are tested on challenging 2D synthetic and experimental data sets. They outperform direct reconstruction approaches for strong noise levels and limited angle measurements, offering immediate benefits in terms of acquisition time and quality. This work provides a basic platform for the investigation of future advanced regularisation methods in photoacoustic tomography.},

Here we show one can usually obtain the same learning curve on both training and test sets by instead increasing the batch size during training. This procedure is successful for stochastic gradient descent (SGD), SGD with momentum, Nesterov momentum, and Adam. It reaches equivalent test accuracies after the same number of training epochs, but with fewer parameter updates, leading to greater parallelism and shorter training times. We can further reduce the number of parameter updates by increasing the learning rate {\$}\backslashepsilon{\$} and scaling the batch size {\$}B \backslashpropto \backslashepsilon{\$}. Finally, one can increase the momentum coefficient {\$}m{\$} and scale {\$}B \backslashpropto 1/(1-m){\$}, although this tends to slightly reduce the test accuracy. Crucially, our techniques allow us to repurpose existing training schedules for large batch training with no hyper-parameter tuning.

abstract = {A new, freely available third party MATLAB toolbox for the simulation and reconstruction of photoacoustic wave fields is described. The toolbox, named k-Wave, is designed to make realistic photoacoustic modeling simple and fast. The forward simulations are based on a k-space pseudo-spectral time domain solution to coupled first-order acoustic equations for homogeneous or heterogeneous media in one, two, and three dimensions. The simulation functions can additionally be used as a flexible time reversal image reconstruction algorithm for an arbitrarily shaped measurement surface. A one-step image reconstruction algorithm for a planar detector geometry based on the fast Fourier transform (FFT) is also included. The architecture and use of the toolbox are described, and several novel modeling examples are given. First, the use of data interpolation is shown to considerably improve time reversal reconstructions when the measurement surface has only a sparse array of detector points. Second, by comparison with one-step, FFT-based reconstruction, time reversal is shown to be sufficiently general that it can also be used for finite-sized planar measurement surfaces. Last, the optimization of computational speed is demonstrated through parallel execution using a graphics processing unit.},

The key idea is to first specify a class of optimization algorithms using a generic iterative scheme involving only linear operations and applications of proximal operators. This scheme contains many modern primal-dual first-order solvers like the Douglas-Rachford and hybrid gradient methods as special cases. Moreover, we show convergence to an optimal point for a new method which also belongs to this class. Next, we interpret the generic scheme as a neural network and use unsupervised training to learn the best set of parameters for a specific class of objective functions while imposing a fixed number of iterations. In contrast to other approaches of "learning to optimize", we present an approach which learns parameters only in the set of convergent schemes. As use cases, we consider optimization problems arising in tomographic reconstruction and image deconvolution, and in particular a family of total variation regularization problems.},

title = "Image reconstruction in a passive element enriched photoacoustic tomography setup",
abstract = "Photoacoustic imaging is a relatively new imaging technology, in which an object is illuminated with optical energy and where in return measurements are taken in the acoustical domain, in order to image the optical absorption distribution inside the object. In this thesis we focus on an experimental setup, named the Passive Element enRiched PhotoAcoustic Tomography (PER-PAT) imaging setup, that is being developed by the Biomedical Photonic Imaging (BMPI) group of the University of Twente. With this setup it is not only possible to image the optical absorption distribution, but also the speed of sound distribution and acoustic attenuation distribution at the same time, by adding carefully positioned passive elements into the setup. These passive elements act as ultrasound point sources when being illuminated with pulsed optical energy. The work that is presented in this thesis deals with the signal processing that is necessary to transform the measured pressure signals with a PER-PAT imaging setup into reconstructions of these three distributions. This work is divided into four parts. The first part is about calibration of the imaging setup. Calibration of the setup is necessary because, in order to do a good reconstruction, the exact geometrical parameters of the setup need to be known. The second part is about the pre-processing step which is necessary for the reconstruction of the speed of sound and acoustic attenuation distributions. In this pre-processing step, we extract the time delay and attenuation factors that are encountered by acoustic signals traveling from these passive elements to our ultrasound detector elements. In the third part we discuss the reconstruction of actual speed of sound and acoustic attenuation distributions from the, in the previous part, extracted time delay and attenuation factors. We propose an algorithm that can be used to reconstruct these distributions from a PER-PAT setup containing one or more passive elements. The last part contains our approach and findings on reconstructing the optical absorption distribution. Altogether, we conclude that we have developed successful algorithms and methods for the image reconstruction problem with the PER-PAT imaging setup.",

abstract = {Photoacoustic Tomography (PAT) is an emerging biomedical "imaging from coupled physics" technique, in which the image contrast is due to optical absorption, but the information is carried to the surface of the tissue as ultrasound pulses. Many algorithms and formulae for PAT image reconstruction have been proposed for the case when a complete data set is available. In many practical imaging scenarios, however, it is not possible to obtain the full data, or the data may be sub-sampled for faster data acquisition. In such cases, image reconstruction algorithms that can incorporate prior knowledge to ameliorate the loss of data are required. Hence, recently there has been an increased interest in using variational image reconstruction. A crucial ingredient for the application of these techniques is the adjoint of the PAT forward operator, which is described in this article from physical, theoretical and numerical perspectives. First, a simple mathematical derivation of the adjoint of the PAT forward operator in the continuous framework is presented. Then, an efficient numerical implementation of the adjoint using a k-space time domain wave propagation model is described and illustrated in the context of variational PAT image reconstruction, on both 2D and 3D examples including inhomogeneous sound speed. The principal advantage of this analytical adjoint over an algebraic adjoint (obtained by taking the direct adjoint of the particular numerical forward scheme used) is that it can be implemented using currently available fast wave propagation solvers.},

abstract = {In this paper, we propose a novel deep convolutional neural network (CNN)-based algorithm for solving ill-posed inverse problems. Regularized iterative algorithms have emerged as the standard approach to ill-posed inverse problems in the past few decades. These methods produce excellent results, but can be challenging to deploy in practice due to factors including the high computational cost of the forward and adjoint operators and the difficulty of hyper parameter selection. The starting point of our work is the observation that unrolled iterative methods have the form of a CNN (filtering followed by point-wise non-linearity) when the normal operator (H*H, the adjoint of H times H) of the forward model is a convolution. Based on this observation, we propose using direct inversion followed by a CNN to solve normal-convolutional inverse problems. The direct inversion encapsulates the physical model of the system, but leads to artifacts when the problem is ill-posed; the CNN combines multiresolution decomposition and residual learning in order to learn to remove these artifacts while preserving image structure. We demonstrate the performance of the proposed network in sparse-view reconstruction (down to 50 views) on parallel beam X-ray computed tomography in synthetic phantoms as well as in real experimental sinograms. The proposed network outperforms total variation-regularized iterative reconstruction for the more realistic phantoms and requires less than a second to reconstruct a 512 x 512 image on GPU.},

We extend the variational regularisation scheme to a Bregman iteration framework to improve the reconstruction and therefore the segmentation.

abstract = {The analysis of MR images is evolving from qualitative to quantitative. More and more, the question asked by clinicians is how much and where, rather than a simple statement on the presence or absence of abnormalities. The authors present a study in which the results obtained with a semiautomatic, multispectral segmentation technique are quantitatively compared to manually delineated regions. The core of the semiautomatic image analysis system is a supervised artificial neural network classifier augmented with dedicated preand postprocessing algorithms, including anisotropic noise filtering and a surface-fitting method for the correction of spatial intensity variations. The study was focused on the quantitation of white matter lesions in the human brain. A total of 36 images from six brain volumes was analyzed twice by each of two operators, under supervision of a neuroradiologist. Both the intra- and interrater variability of the methods were studied in terms of the average tissue area detected per slice, the correlation coefficients between area measurements, and a measure of similarity derived from the kappa statistic. The results indicate that, compared to a manual method, the use of the semiautomatic technique not only facilitates the analysis of the images, but also has similar or lower intra- and interrater variabilities.},

abstract = {Photoacoustic tomography (PAT) is an emerging and non-invasive hybrid imaging modality for visualizing light absorbing structures in biological tissue. The recently invented PAT systems using arrays of 64 parallel integrating line detectors allow capturing photoacoustic projection images in fractions of a second. Standard image formation algorithms for this type of setup suffer from under-sampling due to the sparse detector array, blurring due to the finite impulse response of the detection system, and artifacts due to the limited detection view. To address these issues, in this paper we develop a new direct and non-iterative image reconstruction framework using deep learning. The proposed DALnet combines the universal backprojection (UBP) using dynamic aperture length (DAL) correction with a deep convolutional neural network (CNN). Both subnetworks contain free parameters that are adjusted in the training phase. As demonstrated by simulation and experiment, the DALnet is capable of producing high-resolution projection images of 3D structures at a frame rate of over 50 images per second on a standard PC with NVIDIA TITAN Xp GPU. The proposed network is shown to outperform state-of-the-art iterative total variation reconstruction algorithms in terms of reconstruction speed as well as in terms of various evaluation metrics.},

Since angiogenesis, one of the hallmarks of cancer, leads to increased vascularity, photoacoustics holds promise in imaging breast cancer as shown in proof-of-principle studies. Here for the first time, we investigate if there are specific photoacoustic appearances of breast malignancies which can be related to the tumor vascularity, using an upgraded research imaging system, the Twente Photoacoustic Mammoscope. In addition to comparisons with x-ray and ultrasound images, in subsets of cases the photoacoustic images were compared with MR images, and with vascular staining in histopathology. We were able to identify lesions in suspect breasts at the expected locations in 28 of 29 cases. We discovered generally three types of photoacoustic appearances reminiscent of contrast enhancement types reported in MR imaging of breast malignancies, and first insights were gained into the relationship with tumor vascularity.},

The problem of partitioning multidimensional biomedical data into meaningful regions is perhaps the main roadblock in the automation of biomedical image analysis. Whether the modality of choice is MRI, PET, ultrasound, SPECT, CT, or one of a myriad of microscopy platforms, image segmentation is a vital step in analyzing the constituent biological or medical tar- gets. This book provides a state-of-the-art, comprehensive look at biomedical image segmentation that is accessible to well-equipped undergraduates, graduate students, and research professionals in the biology, biomedical, medical, and engineering fields. Active model methods that have emerged in the last few years are a focus of the book, including parametric active contour and active surface models, active shape models, and geometric active contours that adapt to the image topology. Ad- ditionally, Biomedical Image Analysis: Segmentation details attractive new methods that use graph theory in segmentation of biomedical imagery. Finally, the use of exciting new scale space tools in biomedical image analysis is reported.},

abstract = {Recovering a function or high-dimensional parameter vector from indirect measurements is a central task in various scientific areas. Several methods for solving such inverse problems are well developed and well understood. Recently, novel algorithms using deep learning and neural networks for inverse problems appeared. While still in their infancy, these techniques show astonishing performance for applications like low-dose CT or various sparse data problems. However, theoretical results for deep learning in inverse problems are missing so far. In this paper, we establish such a convergence analysis for the proposed NETT (Network Tikhonov) approach to inverse problems. NETT considers regularized solutions having small value of a regularizer defined by a trained neural network. Opposed to existing deep learning approaches, our regularization scheme enforces data consistency also for the actual unknown to be recovered. This is beneficial in case the unknown to be recovered is not sufficiently similar to available training data. We present a complete convergence analysis for NETT, where we derive well-posedness results and quantitative error estimates, and propose a possible strategy for training the regularizer. Numerical results are presented for a tomographic sparse data problem using the {\$}\backslashell{\^{}}q{\$}-norm of auto-encoder as trained regularizer, which demonstrate good performance of NETT even for unknowns of different type from the training data.},

abstract = {In many practical optoacoustic imaging implementations, dimensionality of the tomographic problem is commonly reduced into two dimensions or 1-D scanning geometries in order to simplify technical implementation, improve imaging speed or increase signal-to-noise ratio. However, this usually comes at a cost of significantly reduced quality of the tomographic data, out-of-plane image artifacts, and overall loss of image contrast and spatial resolution. Quantitative optoacoustic image reconstruction implies therefore collection of point 3-D (volumetric) data from as many locations around the object as possible. Here, we propose and validate an accurate model-based inversion algorithm for 3-D optoacoustic image reconstruction. Superior performance versus commonly-used backprojection inversion algorithms is showcased by numerical simulations and phantom experiments.},

abstract = {Quantification of tissue properties with photoacoustic (PA) imaging typically requires a highly accurate representation of the initial pressure distribution in tissue. Almost all PA scanners reconstruct the PA image only from a partial scan of the emitted sound waves. Especially handheld devices, which have become increasingly popular due to their versatility and ease of use, only provide limited view data because of their geometry. Owing to such limitations in hardware as well as to the acoustic attenuation in tissue, state-of-the-art reconstruction methods deliver only approximations of the initial pressure distribution. To overcome the limited view problem, we present a machine learning-based approach to the reconstruction of initial pressure from limited view PA data. Our method involves a fully convolutional deep neural network based on a U-Net-like architecture with pixel-wise regression loss on the acquired PA images. It is trained and validated on in silico data generated with Monte Carlo simulations. In an initial study we found an increase in accuracy over the state-of-the-art when reconstructing simulated linear-array scans of blood vessels.},

Specifically, we utilize a convolutional neural network (CNN) as a quasi-projection operator within a least squares minimization procedure. The CNN is trained to encode high level information about the class of images being imaged; this information is utilized to mitigate artifacts in intermediate images produced by use of an iterative method. The structure of the method was inspired by the proximal gradient descent method, where the proximal operator is replaced by a deep CNN and the gradient descent step is generalized by use of a linear reconstruction operator. It is demonstrated that this approach improves image quality for several cases of limited-view image reconstruction and that using a CNN in an iterative method increases performance compared to conventional image reconstruction approaches. We test our method on several limited-view image reconstruction problems. Qualitative and quantitative results demonstrate state-of-the-art performance.},

abstract = {Compressive sensing (CS) has proved effective for tomographic reconstruction from sparsely collected data or under-sampled measurements, which are practically important for few-view CT, tomosynthesis, interior tomography, and so on. To perform sparse-data CT, the iterative reconstruction commonly use regularizers in the CS framework. Currently, how to choose the parameters adaptively for regularization is a major open problem. In this paper, inspired by the idea of machine learning especially deep learning, we unfold a state-of-the-art "fields of experts" based iterative reconstruction scheme up to a number of iterations for data-driven training, construct a Learned Experts' Assessment-based Reconstruction Network ("LEARN") for sparse-data CT, and demonstrate the feasibility and merits of our LEARN network. The experimental results with our proposed LEARN network produces a competitive performance with the well-known Mayo Clinic Low-Dose Challenge Dataset relative to several state-of-the-art methods, in terms of artifact reduction, feature preservation, and computational speed. This is consistent to our insight that because all the regularization terms and parameters used in the iterative reconstruction are now learned from the training data, our LEARN network utilizes application-oriented knowledge more effectively and recovers underlying images more favorably than competing algorithms. Also, the number of layers in the LEARN network is only 12, reducing the computational complexity of typical iterative algorithms by orders of magnitude.},

abstract = {In this article, we study several reconstruction methods for the inverse source problem of photoacoustic tomography (PAT) with spatially variable sound speed and damping. The backbone of these methods is the adjoint operators, which we thoroughly analyze in both the {\$}L{\^{}}2{\$}- and {\$}H{\^{}}1{\$}-settings. They are casted in the form of a nonstandard wave equation. We derive the well-pawedness of the aforementioned wave equation in a natural functional space, and also prove the finite speed of propagation. Under the uniqueness and visibility condition, our formulations of the standard iterative reconstruction methods, such as Landweber's and conjugate gradients (CG), achieve a linear rate of convergence in either {\$}L{\^{}}2{\$}- or {\$}H{\^{}}1{\$}-norm. When the visibility condition is not satisfied, the problem is severely ill-posed and one must apply a regularization technique to stabilize the solutions. To that end, we study two classes of regularization methods: (i) iterative, and (ii) variational regularization. In the case of full data, our simulations show that the CG method works best; it is very fast and robust. In the ill-posed case, the CG method behaves unstably. Total variation regularization method (TV), in this case, significantly improves the reconstruction quality.},

We here describe our approach in investigating the application of the PA technique in arthritis. We are developing a CT-geometry version PA finger imager, intended for early clinical assessment of the method. The imager uses two curved array ultrasound detectors each with 64 elements with central frequencies 1.5 and 7.5 MHz respectively, stacked above each other. Both cover approximately 180 degrees of the circle. Illumination is provided with a multiple of optical fiber bundles coupled to a laser-OPO system. Ultrasound imaging is also possible with the system, since the curved arrays are each provided with 12 or 8 ultrasound pulsers. We have investigated systematically imaging of finger vasculature in healthy volunteers using an earlier laboratory prototype.
